# Readings

## Books

I have always enjoyed reading. My friends found it funny to see me deep into the physics book during the college holidays. If they asked why I was reading academics, I would say, “I was getting bored.” It became a joke.

One of my primary teachers said, "*When we understand a topic well, we don’t need to remember it*". That became the foundation of my learning and practically helped me through my school and university days. 

Before 2011, I mostly read computer and programming-related books. Then I read Sapiens, and after that, I started exploring various topics. Usually, upon finishing a book, I try to find a book with contradictory views.

The randomly ordered list here doesn't include everything that I have read, but neither does it mean that everything listed here is well-acquired knowledge.
