# Readings
---

I have always enjoyed reading. My friends found it funny to see me deep into the physics book during the college holidays. If they asked why I was reading academics, I would say, “I was getting bored.” It became a joke.

One of my primary school teachers used to say, "*When we understand something thoroughly, it becomes a part of us. And we don’t need to remember it.*" That has remained the foundation of my learning to this day, thereby the underlying purpose of each of my readings. 

Before 2011, I mostly read computer and programming-related books. Then I read Sapiens, and after that, I started exploring various topics. Usually, upon finishing a book, I try to find a book with contradictory views.

The randomly ordered list here doesn't include everything that I have read, but neither does it mean that everything listed here is well-acquired knowledge.
