## About me

I have repeatedly built software engineering teams for self-sufficiency, high performance, and continuous improvement. The leadership style I believe in is an unconventional, curious, and thought-provoking. As much as building software and reading books give me joy, writing and speaking (to share experiences and knowledge) are equally fulfilling. 'A wallflower and a bold introvert' might describe my personality well.
