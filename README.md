## About me

I facilitate software engineering teams for self-sufficiency, high performance, and continuous improvement. I’m unconventional, curious, and thought-provoking. As much as I enjoy building software and reading books, I’m also a writer and a proud mono-speaker. 'A wallflower and a bold introvert' can describe my personality well.
