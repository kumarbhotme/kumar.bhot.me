## About me

I facilitate software engineering teams for self-sufficiency, high performance, and continuous improvement through an unconventional, curious, and thought-provoking style. As much as building software and reading books give me joy, writing and (mono-) speaking are equally fulfilling. 'A wallflower and a bold introvert' might describe my personality well.
