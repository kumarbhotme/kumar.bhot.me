<h1>About me</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Focus dictates direction</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/img/kumar.png" width="200" class="img border left" alt="Kumar Bhot" />I have repeatedly built software engineering teams for self-sufficiency, high performance, and continuous improvement. The leadership style I believe in is an unconventional, curious, and thought-provoking. As much as building software and reading books give me joy, writing and speaking (to share experiences and knowledge) are equally fulfilling. 'A wallflower and a bold introvert' might describe my personality well.</p>

<h2>I am nothing but a sum of my experiences</h2>
<p>During the two and half decades of my career in the software industry, I was very fortunate to play almost every role that a software product team has to offer. Graphics Designer, Usability Analyst, User Experience Designer, UI Developer, Frontend Architect, Backend Developer, Database Designer, QA Automation Engineer, and Product Owner. During my short and failed entrepreneurship stunt, I was also invested heavily in Product Management and Technical Writing, apart from everything else.</p>

<p>Among all my work experiences, the tenure at Dell probably remains the most learning one. Not only did I have to engineer products on a huge scale, lead the engineering process maturity efforts with Scrum, but also take on a tough leadership role for a crucial product team. It was a multi-dimensional enhancement to my career with business, technology, people, and process knowledge boost. The extraordinarily talented individuals and leaders that I worked with there, made it unforgettable.</p>

<h2>Action with passion is the duty</h2>
<p>I admire passion for software product development and a no-nonsense approach to engineering leadership. I am often surprised by the waste software teams continuously produce and yet proudly label our field as 'engineering'. In my honest opinion, we have forgotten the meaning of the word 'engineering'.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/german-engineer.png" width="200" class="img border left" alt="Engineering" />My friend's description of ‘Engineering’ is fascinating! <em>When an Engineer is asked to make a perfect sphere, she will create an instrument and a process that anybody thereafter can use to create a perfect sphere</em>. That is also my definition of engineering — an excellent application of science. The intention is always to design away repetition, so that creativity can focus on the next innovation.</p>

<p>Happy, diverse, and synchronized engineering teams can push innovation to its limits. History inspires me and I believe that we are standing on the shoulders of our previous generation of engineers. The impeccable production efficiency the Automobile and Mechanical Industries have achieved is hard to ignore. As scientific as the Best Engineering Practices are, there is a lot of sense and logic in the evolutionary journey from chaos to Waterfall to Lean to Agile and Scrum.</p>

<p>My efforts remain invested in two important initiatives: (1) Better Professional, and (2) Management Engineering. 'Better Professional' is an attempt to explain simple practical improvements for professionals facing mediocre performance challenge and help them rise to a thriving and fulfilling career champion. And 'Management Engineering' equips software engineering leaders with some powerful scientific tools and techniques.</p>
